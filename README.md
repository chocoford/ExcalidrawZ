[Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) is a very useful web app, but the lack of file management can be troublesome and unsettling. We often need to manually save and maintain multiple different Excalidraw files. Therefore, ExcalidrawZ has wrapped it up to automatically save edited files for users and added file grouping functionality. In future versions, iCloud automatic backup will also be added to greatly reduce the insecurity of using a web app.

Safety is a feature that ExcalidrawZ highly prioritize as a local client. To ensure this, ExcalidrawZ performs a checkpoint record of the file before you loading another file. You can tap the button on the top right of app to view the history.
